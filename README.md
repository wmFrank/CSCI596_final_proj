## 1.Introduction
The goal of our project is to use D-MPNN to predict molecular property which will accelerate the development of new chemical product. 

## 2.Dataset
- We used scraped data from PoLyInfo database by Japan National Institute for Materials Science.
- We extracted the rheological property (melt viscosity) and electrical property (electrical dispersion) and use it as input to the D-MPNN.

## 3.Objective
- Apply D-MPNN to this new dataset to predict some property of

- Visualize some property of polymers during the training process via t-SNE to reveal some pattern.
