# CSCI596 Final Project
This is the repo for the final project of CSCI-596 class in USC.
## D-MPNN Molecular Property Prediction
The goal of our project is to use D-MPNN to predict molecular property which will accelerate the development of new chemical product. 

### dataset
We used scraped data from PoLyInfo database by Japan National Institute for Materials Science.
We extracted the rheological property (melt viscosity) and electrical property (electrical dispersion) and use it as input to the D-MPNN.
